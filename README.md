# Hospital-Management-System
This is a Hospital Management System created in python for my 12th class CS project. It also has GUI created with the python module Tkinter and the database is handled by MySQL.

Do this before running!

1). Create a database in your MySql named "hospitalav" and create a table inside it named 
patients with attributes (patientID,name,age,disease_illness,doctorname,phonenumber,address).
2). Copy and paste the AV folder in your Program Files Folder in C drive i.e. C:\Program Files or wherever your Program files folder is.
3). Run through mainscreen.py which is inside C:\Program Files\AV\HMS\OUR SCRIPTS.

NOTE: also change your MySql password in mainscreen.py at line no. 15.
